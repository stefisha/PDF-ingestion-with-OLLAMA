"""
Streamlit application for PDF-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Ollama + LangChain.

This application allows users to upload a PDF, process it, and then ask questions about the content using a selected language model. The workflow involves loading the PDF, extracting text, splitting the content into chunks, creating vector embeddings, and storing them in a vector database (Chroma). Users can query the content, and the system retrieves the most relevant chunks based on semantic similarity, which are then used by the language model to generate answers.
